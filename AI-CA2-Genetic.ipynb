    "Fitness defiend in this problem is the accuracy of our prediction for each chromosome. The fitness of a chromosome solution is determined by how close it is to being the actual solution for the problem. For finding the fitness value of each chromosome, we defined `calculate_fitness` function. In this function, we decode the encoded text and then calculate how many words in the decoded text is in the dictionary. The number of these words is the fitness value for each chromosome. Finally we sort our population based on chromosome fitness in reverse mode because we want to choose the best of them for the next generation.\n",

    "### Crossover\n",
    "Crossover relates to the analogy of genes within each parent chromosome mixing together in the hopes of creating a fitter child chromosome. Create two new child chromosomes by crossing over parent genes. This makes it possible that if part of the selected genes are suitable and part is inappropriate, the improper part is likely to be discarded, thus combining the part that we think is appropriate with another part of the chromosome that brings us closer to the answer. We consider 0.3 for the crossover probability and it is constant during the execution of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crossover function requires two parents to be selected from the population pool. Pick two chromosomes from the population based on their rank and get them to compete against each other. In the `crossover` function, we choose one points and then copy the values between this points to the offspring and then complete the chromosome. The crossover happens in *70%* of the population.\n",
    "### Mutation\n",
    "The mutation function is applied to a chromosome, using a method to mutate and modify it in the hope that it can achieve a better chromosome. This operation is performed after each crossover, because we may be stuck in a certain state every time after this operation. By slightly changing these chromosomes, we can get out of this state and get closer to the answer. we have chosen a variable *mutation_rate* which is the mutation probabality and its default value is *0.08* to make more change to chromosomes. Whenever we are close to the solution, we decrease it by *0.002* and whenever we are in a local maximum, we increase it by *0.002*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `mutation` function, we mutate a chromosome by picking a gene, and then replace it with a new random gene. The initial mutation rate is *0.08*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Population\n",
    "With all the above functions implemented we can generate the new population. First we need all of the fitness values in sorted order so we could know and rank chromosomes. After passing some of the chromosomes based on elitism probability, the remaining chromosomes will be chosen to be crossed over or mutated. We use rank base selection for this project, because of the *FPS* problem in making chromosome bios. Also, We use **ELITISM** selection method. This means we copy *30%* of the best chromosomes to the next generation, the remain, *70%*, used for crossover and mutation."

Then traverse all the chromosomes to check for solution. if solution not found, select the fittest chromosomes and preserve them for the next generation ( *30* elites in new generation). Took first *30* as elites(elites would definately be part of the next generation). For the remaining *70*, randomly selected two candidates from the population and performed crossover among them. Mutation is done on each candidate. Then append elites into the end of the population. These will not have been affected by crossover or mutation. Calculate new adaptive mutation rate. We continue doing this until we get a fitness value of *1*. This indicates we have successfully found a solution to the decoding problem. To avoid biasing chromosomes, we can Re-generate the population if for example *100* generations have passed with the fittest two chromosomes always having the same fitness."

      "Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration. I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of the last four months it has been made probableâ€”through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in Americaâ€”that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.\n",
      "\n",
      "This phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivableâ€”though much less certainâ€”that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslovakia, while the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo.\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America. One possible way of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial capacity. His task might comprise the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "a)  to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the further development, and put forward recommendations for Government action, giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uranium ore for the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "b)  to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being carried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories, by providing funds, if such funds be required, through his contacts with private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause, and perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the necessary equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizsacker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated.\n",

    "For arbitrarily large population sizes the accuracy of the genetic algorithm approaches, but does not reach, *100%*. The greater the population size the greater the chance that the initial state of the population will contain a chromosome representing the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For small population sizes, mutation will have to be more prominent in order to compensate for smaller population\n",
    "### 2.\n",
    "The increase in population size causes the number of generations to converge to increase. This appears to be due to the overall increase in probability that mutation will occur. If mutation occurs for large population sizes, more generations are needed to eliminate the mutated chromosomes. Increase of the population size, above *100* chromosomes, does not improve the solution accuracy. Moreover, the computational time is increased significantly. If we increase the population size at each iteration, both speed of convergence and accuracy will increase. The variable population-size genetic algorithm is more efficient than the standard genetic algorithm.\n",
    " \n",
    "### 3.\n",
    "The most important effect of mutation is to generate new chromosomes using random abilities, increase the diversity in\n",
    "the population and to prevent getting stuck in local maximums or at least lower probability of it. So without mutation,the individuals in the population will be too similar, the speed of the algorithm will be reduced and in some cases we simply don't reach the goal because there would be a kind of bias in chromosomes after tens or hundreds iterations. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we use just crossover in the genetic algorithm, its very potential to stuck in the local extremum for a long time. So, the mutation is an important part of the genetic algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.\n",
    "Crossover is more effective than mutation and causes more accuracy. Crossover leads to making a new generation. It makes completely new solutions and leads to significant improvement in the fitness scores. But, as we said, using just crossover may lead to stuck in some situations. So, mutation helps to change the current answer a little to make a possibly better generation. As we saw experimentally and as it's resonable, mutation is more effective in small population-size because of the ability of generating new chromosomes even when chromosomes are similar.\n",
    "### 5.\n",
    "If this happens to us, it means that we are stuck at a local maximum point and we have to get out of this point. To prevent chromosomes stability, when maximum fitness of our model gets below 90% we increase mutation and crossover probability to cause more changes and if maximum fitness of our model remains the same for a number of generation we increase mutation and crossover probability to cause more changes. Also we can store history of generations and if we are repeating on a fitness for example for 100 times Then i change the probabilty of mutationRate for one generation to get out of this situation. \n",
