Then traverse all the chromosomes to check for solution. if solution not found, select the fittest chromosomes and preserve them for the next generation(120 elites in new generation). Took first 120 as elites(elites would definately be part of the next generation). For the remaining 80, randomly selected two candidates from the population and performed crossover among them. Mutation is done on each candidate. Create the rest of the candidates and select parents from population via a tournament. Then append elites into the end of the population. These will not have been affected by crossover or mutation. Calculate new adaptive mutation rate. We continue doing this until we get a fitness value of 1. This indicates we have successfully found a solution to the sudoku problem. To avoid biasing chromosomes, we can Re-generate the population if for example 100 generations have passed with the fittest two chromosomes always having the same fitness."

    "### Questions\n",
    "#### 1.\n",
    "We choose tournament selection because it can be implemented efficiently as no sorting of the population is not required.\n",
    "#### 2.\n",
    "Fitness function should be sufficiently fast to compute and must quantitatively measure how fit a given solution is or how fit individuals can be produced from the given solution. Our fitness function satisfies these criteria and its suitable for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.\n",
    "**cross over** : This makes it possible that if part of the selected genes are suitable and part is inappropriate, the improper part is likely to be discarded, thus combining the part that we think is appropriate with another part of the chromosome that brings us closer to the answer. We consider 0.85 for the crossover probability and it is constant during the execution of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**mutation** : This operation is performed after each crossover, because we may be stuck in a certain state every time after this operation. By slightly changing these chromosomes, we can get out of this state and get closer to the answer. we have chosen a variable mutationRate which is the mutation probabality and its default value is 0.5 to make more change to chromosomes. Whenever we are close to the solution, we decrease it by 0.002 and whenever we are in a local maximum, we increase it by 0.002.\n",
    "#### 4.\n",
    "If this happens to us, it means that we are stuck at a local maximum point and we have to get out of this point. To prevent chromosomes stability, when maximum fitness of our model gets below 90% we increase mutation and crossover probability to cause more changes and if maximum fitness of our model remains the same for a number of generation we increase mutation and crossover probability to cause more changes. Also we can store history of generations and if we are repeating on a fitness for example for 100 times Then i change the probabilty of mutationRate for one generation to get out of this situation. "
