# Decrypt Replacement Encryption Genetics
Computer Assignment #2, Artificial Intelligence Course, University of Tehran

Goal of this project is finding the key which a text was encoded with and decrypting the encoded text with it. 
To do so Genetic Algorithm is used. 
The encrypted text is given to the code along with a dicitonary of words that the encoded words after decription will be amongst them and the algorithm will solve the problem and give back the encryption key and the decoded text.
